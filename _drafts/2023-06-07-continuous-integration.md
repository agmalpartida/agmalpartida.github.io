Software with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and frugality.

Meaning, for example, that Alacritty will never "call home" to gather telemetry, aka track you. It will never haze you with automated update notices. There’s no package manager, there’s no GUI for settings, nor for menus, it doesn’t have tabs, there’s nothing... just a void of pure, unadulterated nihilism.

This either sucks less, or sucks more, depending on your personality.
